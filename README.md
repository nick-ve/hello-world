# hello-world
My first GitHub repository for testing using the GitHub tutorial
Just some text to try out editing and committing changes.
And now a line added via SVN.
It seems that the newlines are not getting through correctly.
Will test this later.
=== It turns out everything is o.k.
=== It was just in the comments area of the commits that the
=== newlines were removed.
=== So, using TSVN to manipulate things on GitHub works fine.
