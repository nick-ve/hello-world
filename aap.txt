Dit is file aap in trunk
And a new line
New line added on old Dell laptop with TSVN 1.4.5
And now a new line added on the new DELL laptop with TSVN 1.7
This line is added on my tablet using Quick editor which is
 Fast
 Handles large files
And this line has been added on my newest Dell laptop
via the TortoiseGit facility instead of the good old TortoiseSVN.
Note : Both TortoiseSVN and TortoiseGit are installed next to each other,
so both facilities can still be used.
